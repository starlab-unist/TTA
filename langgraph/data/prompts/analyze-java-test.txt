The JUnit comparison between the original and transformed Java code failed. Analyze the test output, source code, transformed code, and test cases to determine if the failure is due to:

An issue in the transformed code (e.g., it produces different outputs, compilation errors, or signature changes).

An issue in the test cases (e.g., incorrect inputs, invalid assertions, package/method naming mismatch, or precision errors in floating-point checks).

Provide a brief explanation of the likely cause and suggest whether to:

Conclude the codes are not equivalent.

Revise the test cases and retry.

Test cases:
```
{test_cases}
``

Test output:
```
{test_result}
```

Output format:

Cause: [Transformed code issue | Test case issue]

Explanation: [Your explanation]

Action: [Conclude not equivalent | Revise test cases]
