The unittest comparing the original and transformed code failed. Analyze the test output, source code, transformed code, and test cases to determine if the failure is due to:
1. An issue in the transformed code (e.g., it produces different outputs).
2. An issue in the test cases (e.g., incorrect inputs, invalid assertions, or syntax errors).

Provide a brief explanation of the likely cause and suggest whether to:
- Revise the codes are not equivalent.
- Revise the test cases and retry.

Test cases:
```
{test_cases}
```

Test output:
{test_result}

Output format:
- Cause: [Transformed code issue | Test case issue]
- Explanation: [Your explanation]
- Action: [Revise transformed code | Revise test cases]
