Please transform the following code into a functionally equivalent version with a different implementation style.
The transformation must follow these rules:
- The output must perform the exact same task as the input code.
- Change the method name. Do not reuse the original function name.
- Maintain the original logic and output, but make the code look clearly different.
- It’s allowed (and encouraged) to change variable names, control structures (e.g., for → while), or replace constructs with alternative approaches (e.g., recursion vs iteration).

When writing the transformed code, write what has changed in the comments below the transformed code.

This is an example. Check the example, and make sure the format user want.
# Example
Transform this code:
```{language}
{source_example}
```

Answer:
```{language}
{target_example}
```

Now, Your turn!

Transform this code:
```{language}
{source}
```
