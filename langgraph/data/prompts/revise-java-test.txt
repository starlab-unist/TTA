Analyze the following Java source code and its transformed version to generate a JUnit 5 test class that checks if both codes produce the same output for the same inputs.

Requirements:
- Use JUnit 5 with parameterized tests.
- Do NOT add any `package` declaration.
- Create exactly ONE public test class.
- To avoid name collisions with existing compiled sources, wrap the original and transformed implementations as nested static classes named `OriginalImpl` and `TransformedImpl` inside the test class. If needed, copy only the target methods into these wrappers and make them `public static`.
- The test class must define a `provideTestCases()` method that returns `Stream<Arguments>` created from the given Python unittest inputs (convert to appropriate Java types).
- The test method MUST be annotated with `@ParameterizedTest` and `@MethodSource("provideTestCases")`, and must call both implementations with the SAME inputs and compare results using `assertEquals`. For floating-point comparisons, use delta if necessary.
- Generate at least 10 test inputs that are simple values (e.g., integers, strings).
- Ensure the test case is a valid Java Unit jest.

The generated test code will be combined with the source and transformed code in the format:
{{source_code}}
{{transformed_code}}
{{test_cases}}


Previous test cases:
```
{{test_cases}}
```

Failure analysis:
{{failure_analysis}}

Output the revised test case code with source code and transformed code.
