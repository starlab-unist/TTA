# Automated Test Generation and Evaluation

This repository supports running test generation experiments and evaluating the effectiveness of the generated tests in terms of coverage and error detection.

## 0. Build with docker
```bash
docker build -t <image name> .
```
This is an example command for running a container, assuming that the server has a total of four NVIDIA GPUs.
```bash
docker run -itd   -w /root   --name <container name>   --runtime=nvidia   --gpus all   --device=/dev/nvidia-uvm   --device=/dev/nvidia-uvm-tools   --device=/dev/nvidia-modeset   --device=/dev/nvidiactl   --device=/dev/nvidia0   --device=/dev/nvidia1   --device=/dev/nvidia2   --device=/dev/nvidia3 <image name>
```

## 1. Run Experiments

To run all experiments, simply execute:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

This will generate tests for five target projects using both our system and the baseline (TESTPILOT).

This automated script conducts experiments using the Qwen2.5-72B model, with the temperature set to 0.7.

## 2. Evaluate Test Coverage

We evaluate statement coverage across three test sources:

* **System (ours):** `/root/eval/coverage/coverage_*.log`
* **TESTPILOT:** `/root/eval/testpilot/coverage_*.log`
* **Developer-written tests:** `/root/projects/*/coverage.log`

### Metric

For each of the five projects, compute the following metric:

```
(system or testpilot coverage) / (developer coverage)
```

This ratio measures how effective the generated tests are compared to the original developer-written tests. A higher ratio indicates better test coverage.

---

## 3. Evaluate Error Detection Rate

We test our system-generated tests against 10 known buggy program versions.

### Logs

Test results are stored in:

```
/root/eval/error/test_*.log
```

### Metric

Count how many tests **fail** (i.e., they correctly detect a bug). Then compute:

```
(number of failing tests) / 10
```

This is the **error detection rate**. A higher rate indicates stronger bug-detection capability of the generated tests.

## 4. Expected Results
The results were obtained by running an automated script.
